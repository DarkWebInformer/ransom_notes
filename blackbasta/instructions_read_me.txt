Our name is BlackBasta Syndicate, and we are the largest, most advanced, and most prolific organized group currently existing. We are the ultimate cyber tradecraft with a credential record of taking down the most advanced, high-profile, and defended companies one can ever imagine. You can Google us later; what you need to know now is that we are business people just like you. 

We have your data and encrypted your files, but in less than an hour, we can put things back on track: if you pay for our recovery services, you get a decryptor, the data will be deleted from all of our systems and returned to you, and we will give you a security report explaining how we got you.

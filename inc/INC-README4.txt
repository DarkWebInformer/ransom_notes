Greetings!
We inform you that the INC ransomware team hacked into your corporate network and downloaded more than a terabyte of confidential information.
As proof, we have attached some of the downloaded files to the email.
We know the attitude of your country's legislation in the field of cybersecurity, and in order not to give the incident loud publicity, we did not encrypt your network and sent mail only to management and official mail. We can settle this amicably.

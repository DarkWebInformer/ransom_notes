-----> What guarantees are that we won't fool you?
We are not a politically motivated group and we want nothing more than money.
If you pay, we will provide you with decryption software and destroy the stolen data.
After you pay the ransom, you will quickly restore your systems and make even more money.
Treat this situation simply as a paid training for your system administrators, because it is due to your corporate network not being properly configured that we were able to attack you.
Our pentest services should be paid just like you pay the salaries of your system administrators. Get over it and pay for it.
If we don't give you a decryptor or delete your data after you pay, no one will pay us in the future.
You can get more information about us on Twitter https://twitter.com/hashtag/incransom?f=live

-----> Warning! Don't delete or modify encrypted files, it will lead to problems with decryption of files!
-----> Don't go to the police or the FBI for help. They won't help you.
The police will try to prohibit you from paying the ransom in any way.
The first thing they will tell you is that there's no guarantee to decrypt your files and remove stolen files.
This is not true, we can do a test decryption before paying and your data will be guaranteed to be removed because it's a matter of our reputation.
Paying the ransom to us is much cheaper and more profitable than paying fines and legal fees.
The police and the FBI don't care what losses you suffer as a result of our attack, and we'll help you get rid of all your problems for a modest sum of money.
If you're worried that someone will trace your bank transfers, you can easily buy cryptocurrency for cash, thus leaving no digital trail that someone from your company paid our ransom.
The police and FBI won't be able to stop lawsuits from your customers for leaking personal and private information.
The police and FBI won't protect you from repeated attacks. 

-----> Don't go to recovery companies!
They are essentially just middlemen who will make money off you and cheat you.
We are well aware of cases where recovery companies tell you that the ransom price is $5M dollars, but in fact they secretly negotiate with us for $1M.
If you approached us directly without intermediaries you would pay several times less.

-----> For those who have cyber insurance against ransomware attacks.
Insurance companies require you to keep your insurance information secret.
In most cases, we find this information and download it.

-----> If you do not pay the ransom, we will attack your company again in the future.
